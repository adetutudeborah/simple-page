      <p>
        When Zikora, a DC lawyer from Nigeria, tells her equally high-powered
        lover that sheâ€™s pregnant, he abandons her. But itâ€™s Zikoraâ€™s demanding,
        self-possessed mother, in town for the birth, who makes Zikora feel like
        a lonely little girl all over again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stunned by the speed with which her ideal life fell apart, she turns to
        reflecting on her motherâ€™s painful past and struggle for dignity.
        Preparing for motherhood, Zikora begins to see more clearly what her own
        mother wants for her, for her new baby, and for herself.
